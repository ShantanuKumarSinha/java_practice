Problem Description
You are given the dimensions of a rectangular board of size A x B. You need to print all the possible paths from top-left corner to bottom-right corner of the board.

You can only move down (denoted by 'D') or right (denoted by 'R') at any point in time.

NOTE : You need to return all the paths in Lexicographically sorted order. A lexicographic order is an arrangement of characters in alphabetical order.


Problem Constraints
1 <= A, B <= 8



Input Format
First Argument is an Integer A, which denotes the Row Index.
Second Argument is an Integer B, which denotes the Column Index.


Output Format
Return a String Array, which denotes all the possible paths in separate lines. The paths should be returned in the Lexicographical order.


Example Input
Input 1 :
A = 3 , B = 2
Input 2 :
A = 1 , B = 2


Example Output
Output 1 :
DDR DRD RDD
Output 2 :
R


Example Explanation
For Input 1 :
The size of the matrix is 3x2.
You are currently standing at (0, 0), the possible paths to bottom right cell (2, 1) are :
- (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (2, 1)  which corresponds to DDR
- (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1)  which corresponds to DRD
- (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1)  which corresponds to RDD

NOTE: Printing DRD, RDD before DDR would be incorrect as the output should be given in Lexicographical order.
For Input 2 :
The size of the matrix is 1x2.
You are currently standing at (0, 0), the possible paths to bottom right cell (0, 1) are :
- (0, 0) -> (0, 1)  which corresponds to R

This is the only possible path.
